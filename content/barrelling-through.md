The first thing I tell junior programmers is: **keep going**.

If you've been programming a while, you know that feeling of
encountering a new project, with a new stack, in a new language. The
feeling is: *OK.* And you roll up your sleeves and get to
work.

But do you remember the first time you were in a professional setting,
in front of a new project with years of engineer-hours invested in it?
You are staring at a foreign IDE for the first time, and a senior
engineer has told you to fix a bug. You have 20 new technologies to
learn, all at once, and you don't have a solid conceptual model for
how they fit together. The syntax might as well be a Dwarf Fortress
game, and you're 10 steps away from even being able to figure out what
to Google.

It's overwhelming.

And, you know what? I still find it overwhelming. I recently started
learning ClojureScript. The recommended first step is basically,
"spend 2 years learning emacs". Then learn the Java ecosystem. Then
learn Clojure. Then learn ClojureScript. Yikes.

But the difference between wet-behind-the-ears, just-graduated Chris
Clark, and the me of today, is that I've had this feeling dozens, or
hundreds, of times before. I just barrel through. I know that all of
this *stuff* was built by other engineers. Some of them were smarter
than me, some of them weren't. It doesn't matter; I have complete
confidence that if I perservere, I will figure it out. No doubts at
all.

So that's what I tell new engineers: When you worry you might *not*
figure it out? That you weren't cut out for this? I've been there, and
then been there again. But you'll figure it out, I promise. Just keep
going.

#### The Second Thing I Tell New Engineers

The second thing I tell new engineers (specifically, new grads) is:

In college, a tough professor might give you a huge
assignment that might take you 20 hours. What a jerk! In the
full-time-work world, that's a project that's done by
Thursday.
