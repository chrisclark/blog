The curve is flattened. We did it!

If I ran a project at my company like this, I would be summarily roasted by my team; we set up success criteria, hit them, and then did nothing (didn't even present the success!)

At some point we sliently shifted the goal to something like "no one should die of coronovirus". This is completely different, and unrealistic.

We went into this knowing CV was here. But hidden away in our homes, we've shifted.

We believe that we can tame nature. It's unacceptable (or perhaps not able to be accepted) that we haven't tamed nature, and bad things happen, and people are going to die.
