1. Know what you want.

If you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there.

Do you care about monthly cost in year 2? Or total cost of ownership in year 1?

Be able to answer these questions:

- What number could the vendor say right now that would get you to say 'yes'?
- How many licenses or users or what volume are you going to need in year 1? How do you want to handle overages?
- What's a reasonable market rate?
- What's your budget?
- What would actually cause you to walk away?

If you are negotiating just to make sure no dollars are left on the table, it'll be an unpleasant and meaningless process. You can get results that way, but I'd rather sign something that I know works for me and gets everyeone excited about the partnership. If I know what I need and I get it, I have no reason to stress about whether or not the vendor is making money.

2. Know your levers

Payment terms. Contract length. Functionality you don't need. Taking on some implementation burden. Signing fast. Paying fast. Serving on a customer panel.

3. The sales rep is on your side, so be on their side too.

Structure pricing so that success is aligned. Let's say you're signing a per-seat licensing agreeement, and you need 10 seats now

Set up external peronsalities and checkpoints. It allows you to 'fight the good fight' on behalf of your vendor and even if you have to push back hard on a term, it's not personal and allows you to stay aligned with the rep.

If you do get caught off guard with a specific question, it will also allow you to create time for yourself to think ("I can't answer that beacuse it's not my decision, but I will check with the team/my CFO and get back to you.")

4. Write it down

Have a crib sheet with your notes and what you want, written down, before any negotiation. You're less likely to back off on the important stuff.

6. Explain why you are going to be a good customer

We're going to be a big account for you one day.

7. Know what's reasonable to expect, and get initial pricing as soon as possible

Get your rep to cough up some sort of number (or range) as soon as you can. You'll know what you're working with. After a while you'll get a sense for how much various solutions are likely to cost, but you can always be surprised. Once you have some sense of where pricing will land, I recommend dropping it until the end of the sales process -- but you don't to spend hours in demos and presentations only to find out price is an order of magnitude different than you expected.

Something that is quoted at 100k per year? I'll bet I can get it for $60k. I probably can't get it for $10k. I should have a sense of that in advance.

Some vendors really need your business (early-stage companies that are as interested in market proof points as they are in profitable customers). Some really don't. I tried to negotiate pricing with a highly profitable, bootstrapped, ggrowing, family-run business. I had zero leverage because the guy I was speaking with really did not care if I signed. "The price is the price. My business has grown 40% this year. We'd love to have you, but the price is the price." He was very willing to walk away.
