If you're a software professional, there are basically two types of companies you might work for; those whose product is fudamentally software (they make money directly from technology), and those that make their money some other way, but rely on a lot of custom software. Let's call the first Type A, and the second Type B.

## Type A Companies

- Microsoft (sells software)
- Twilio (it's a website)
- Dropbox (not software, but clearly a technology company)

## Type B Companies

- Amazon.com (the retailer; not AWS)
- FedEx (fundamentally a logistics company)
- Wells Fargo (and other financial institutions)

## Software Engineer at a Type A company

*Your job is to build awesome technology that customers want to buy.*

It's somewhat easier to be a technologist at a Type A company. The
software you create is very closely tied to revenue, which is
ultimately what drives business. The closer you are to the money, the
closer you are to the beating heart of any company.

Company cultures vary widely, and there are certainly Type A companies
led by sales and marketing, but technology is the golden goose at a
Type A company and technologists are valued
accordingly. Engineering/R&D is a cost center from an accounting
standpoint* , but in practice is ultimately responsible for revenue
generation.

## Software Engineer at a Type B company

*Your job is to support the business goals of the organization.*

There's a bit more of a spectrum here, both in terms of crucial
technology is to the business, and depending on the culture of the
company.

On one end of the spectrum, we have Type B companies like Amazon (the
retailer) that make their money by selling and shipping physical
products, but have a very clear and important dependency on their
retail website. If the website doesn't carefully meet consumer
expectations, sales drop. There is a true customer-facing component to
the software, even if it's not being monetized directly, and
engineering is held in high esteem.

On the other end, we have banks. There's no question that banks run on
software, but the vast majority of it is internally-facing, and the
quality of a bank's customer-facing website, ATM machines, etc, has
much less bearing on the success of the bank. Correspondingly,
engineers at banks are definitively lower on the cultural totem pole
than revenue-generating professionals.

In a Type B company, you really are a cost center, and perhaps one
that's viewed with a certain degree of skepticism. Software
development in particular is more likely to be internally-facing,
rather than customer-facing, and less glamorous IT tasks may be
grouped with engineering. It's more likely to be an auxilliary
function, as opposed to a core competency, and thus more likely to be
outsourced (to a Type A company), or purchased.

But working for a Type B company can also be a heck of a lot of
fun. Your customers are often the folks sitting down the hall from
you. Product feedback is instant. Your users have less variance in
terms of knowledge and environment, and share a lot of tribal
knowledge with you.
