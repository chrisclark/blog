Some days it seems like all I'm good for is buying other companies'
software.

It's a little ridiculous. I get 5-10 emails a day pitching some SaaS
solution. You probably get them too. Recognize any of these subject
lines?

- *Christopher, do you have 15 minutes to connect about my previous note?*
- *Try SaaSly for a week - Get $200*
- *What do Lyft, Hubspot and Instacart all have in common?*
- *wrong person?*
- *Meeting Request - EXCLUSIVE*

My blood pressure went up 10% just copy-pasting those. On the other
hand, I can't fault these sales folks because, once in a while, I'm
actually in market and end up having to buy one of these things.

And that's what this is about -- buying expensive software.

## What's "expensive"?

For our purposes, "expensive" is anything that costs enough money that
the vendor has dedicated sales people who will actually schedule
meetings with you, answer your questions, prepare demos, and negotiate
pricing. Others have written about this before, but basically there is
some threshold where prices jump from, like, $399/mo to $1500/mo. It's
sort of hard to find software that costs
$900/mo<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> because I'm not going to spend that
much money without demos and talking to a sales rep, but it's not
really a large enough sale to support that kind of sales
infrastructure either<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>.

For that reason, most real B2B SaaS solutions start somewhere in the
$2000/mo range. If you're a growing company, at some point you'll
suddenly find that every department in the company wants to buy SaaS
products that are each $2000/mo. Yikes.

I'll walk you how these deals come together, what to expect at each
stage of the purchasing process, help you ask the right questions, and
ultimately negotiate price, while still remaining on great terms with
your vendor.

## Entering the Market

So let's pretend you're in market for a business intelligence tool. Or
a CRM. Or an inventory management solution. Or an email marketing
system. Or possibly you're in market for all of these and SalesForce
has promised that The Force.com Platform (r)(tm) can do all of this,
plus get you out of unpaid parking tickets, and you will have lots of
Success and not too much Software and it's going to be a lovely,
platformy day.

The first thing you have to do is pick a couple of vendors. Even if
you have a strong idea about who will be the best fit, I always like
looking at two vendors, if possible. The competitive dynamics of the
deal will give you some negotiating leverage later on, and even if the
'other' vendor ends up being weak, it'll give you just that much more
conviction about the solution you picked. Anywhere between 2 and 4
vendors is great, and you can always drop unpromising ones at any
point through the process.

Got a couple in mind? Great! If you don't have a contact there
already, just fill out a lead form online and I promise you will have
a sales rep at your doorstep in no time.

## Meet You New Best Friend

This is important to remember: **the sales rep is on your side**. This
is someone who is very interested in both getting this deal done
(therefore at a price you can afford, and with the features you want)
and in making sure the solution is actually a good fit (because all
sorts of things can go sideways after purchase, and that has real
financial consequences for the rep).

Sales reps are your friends. They may frustrate you with their
inability to answer technical questions, or give you a little bit of
the runaround on how a particular feature works, but they are on your
side. So be on theirs. When it comes time to put the screws to the
vendor on pricing, it's your rep who will go to bat with their
managers to get your pricing approved. So be friendly!

## The First Phone Call

You've reached out and made contact with your sales rep via email. It's
looking good and you are now a warm lead. The next step is an initial
call.

It's somewhat unlikely you will actually get a demo of the software in
this first call. Totally annoying, yes, but normal. Deal with it. Your
rep is first going to want to understand your goals and your company,
so she can put together a relevant demo later on. You'll definitely be
asked to explain your role in the company. Regardless of whether I'm
the sole decision-maker or just helping another department make a
purchase, I always make sure the rep knows that I am necessary, but
not sufficient, for getting this deal done. This puts me in a position
where my concerns and questions have to be taken seriously, but also
creates the propsect of additional stakeholders, who I can use as 'the
bad guy' later in negotiations, and to buy myself time if I get in a
jam.

Now, back to that first call: you have some important diligence of
your own that you will need to perform.

But first, you will have to battle your way through the Boring Vendor
PowerPoint of Irrelevance. After a few minutes of standard "can you
see my screen?" GoToMeeting formalities, you'll probably get a
slideshow like this:

#### Slide 1:
- **GIANT COMPANY LOGO**
- Lots of little logos of prominent customers
- *"Trusted by industry leaders"*
- Depending on the sophistication of the sales org, they may have
  taken the dramatic step of *including your company's logo*. +1
  vendor points if so.

#### Slide 2:
- LOTS OF STATS ABOUT RETURN ON INVESTMENT and HOW YOUR COMPANY IS
  GOING TO GET SUPER LASER NINJA POWERS WHEN YOU BUY THIS THING

#### Slide 3:
- List of modules and features. 90% chance of the word "proprietary"
  appearing in at least one of the bullet points.

#### Slide 4:
- I'm not really sure, I've generally tuned out by now. There are
  definitely a few more slides though.

I feel bad zoning out, but unless there's some buying process I'm
unaware of where, like, you end up on sales calls based on that fact
that you both swiped right on each other's LinkedIn profiles, you've
almost certainly read this information on their website. I just never
learn much via cookie-cutter PowerPoint presentations, other than
slide transitions look the least crappy when screen
sharing<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>.

I save my detailed solution and product questions for demos (which
come later) and my approach in the initial call is to just kind of
'uh-huh' my way through the slides as quickly as possible so I can get
to the real goal of the first meeting:

## Vetting the Vendor

You're about to spend a bunch of money, so make sure you understand
who you are partnering with. Here are the questions I like to ask in
the first call (when relevant), and why I ask them:

- **How big is your largest customer? How small is your smallest?**
    - Like Goldilocks, I want to find a vendor that serves customers
      my size. If I'm a tiny customer, I won't be able to get
      attention when I need it. And I don't want to pioneer scaling
      challenges by being the biggest customer.
- **How many customers do you have? How many engineers? Are you
  profitable?**
    - How big is this company? Do they serve lots of companies just
      like mine? Can they fix problems quickly? Are they a startup
      that might suddenly go out of business?
- **Where are you located? What's the support model? Is there phone
  support?**
    - Especailly important if this is critical line-of-business
      software! I can deal with my data viz tool going down for an
      hour, but my warehouses just go idle if my inventory management
      tool is down. So what I really want to know here is: when the
      shit hits the fan, can I talk to a live human being *who can fix
      the problem*? I've had vendors with great phone support, but
      their engineers are all in Asia, so all they could offer was
      sympathy until 10pm when folks started waking up.
- **What's your target customer? What parts of the market are important
  to you in the next 2 years?**
    - It may be the case that you are a pretty good fit for this
      vendor today, but their roadmap has them focusing down-market on
      smaller companies in the next 2 years, and the features that are
      getting built aren't going to be ones you value.
- **Will I be able to do reference calls with similar customers?**
    - Many vendors won't actually set up reference calls until much
      later in the process (I can't blame them -- you can't go out
      hassling your customers for a call every time a lead asks this
      question) but it's important to know you'll be able to do it
      later. If the answer is "We don't do references", that's a major
      red flag for me.
- **Give me an estimate: How long will this take to implement?**
    - I've heard vendors tell me "30 days" but it turns out they are
      running a 45-day project backlog, so total time to launch is
      much longer. If there's a big range, you can ask what's typical,
      and then "What's the fastest you've ever seen a company
      implement?". You know best whether you're going to be typical,
      or fast. This question is also a great gut-check for you own
      knowledge; if you had "a week from purchase to go-live" in your
      head, and then vendor is saying 90 days is typical, maybe you
      don't totally understand what you're getting into.
- **Give me an estimate: How much is this going to cost?**
    - This will be the first and last time you talk about price until
      the end of the process. I try to get a sense of first-year total
      cost of ownership (TCO) by asking about software costs,
      implementation costs, and asking if there are any other types of
      costs I should be aware of. I generally say something like:
      "Based on what you know about what I'm trying to accomplish,
      what kind of costs do companies like mine generally see in the
      first year? Giving me a range is fine, and I won't hold you to
      it. I just want to make sure we're in the same ball park."

There aren't right and wrong answers to the above, but trust your
instincts. You really are going to be partners in making this work, at
least through the sales and implementation period. If the vendor seems
good, but the sales rep seems like an idiot, that's a red flag. If the
rep is great, but the product story seems thin, that's a red
flag. You're about to spend a lot of money, with a contractual
committment that will be hard to unwind. Take your time, be thorough,
and build conviction.

## Getting the demo

To get the most out of a demo, I prepare a list of requirements and
questions in advance, and drill deep into the weeds during the
demo. Don't be afraid to take the technical sales person off
script. This serves two functions. First, it pressure-tests the system
a bit. Is it flexible? Is it intuitive? Are the UX and data metaphors
it uses ones that make sense to you?

Second, you can verify that the capabilities advertised actually work
the way you need them to work.

I've never seen intentional dishonesty during a demo, but it's easy to
interpret a question in a way that allows them to say "yes, we do
that", but might not actually work for you. A real example: I was
buying an inventory management system and asked "do you support EDI?"
(EDI is a standard communication protocal for tracking the status of
orders). The vendor said yes, and they do support it, but it turned
out only for outbound orders, not inbound, which is where I needed
it. You owe it to your company to be tenacious and dig in.

My last tip for demos is to have your screenshot tool of choice
configured and ready to rock. These things can move fast so it's great
to be able to save screenshots of each part of the demo to review
later, and to send to colleagues who might also have questions. If
you're getting demos of multiple solutions, this is especially helpful
as they tend to run together in your memory after a while.

## What's next?

You're honing in on a decision - congratulations! Hopefully you have
at least two vendors that look OK (you only need one, but having two
is great for negotiation purposes). Next up you'll request a pricing
quote, a statement of work (a scope), and a contract. Stay tuned for
part 2 - how to negotiate price, and get the deal done.

## Footnotes

<a name="footnote1">1</a>: The exception is things that start of cheap
and get expensive based on usage

<a name="footnote2">2</a>: I think there may be an opportunity for a
start-up that doesn't really innovate on product but enters some
market like mid-market CRM and innovates on the sales process by
somehow avoiding it entirely, and charging e.g. $900/mo, which would
radically undercut their competitors).

<a name="footnote3">3</a>: The answer is: They all look terrible. Save
the special effects budget for somethign else.
