Meeting this morning with the executive team; got asked a bit of a surprise question about a payments issue we had last week and did an OK job answering it. Probably overly technical response and not one that is right for the executive audience.

While that was happening, I had a couple of follow-ups with HR around a personnel issue (someone needing to take medical leave).

One on ones with two of my direct reports; head of product design and head of product managment. We're re-valibrating some of our target metrics around mobile app usage and add-to-cart rates because those numbers changed on us over the past month with COVID.

Had a quick break and worked on some medium-complicated SQL analysis of customer retention. It's something that should probably be done by the analytics team, but it won't take that long and my CEO and I are particularly interested in it, so I've just decided to do it myself.

Sent an email to kick off a new working group focused on improving visibility into our order analytics. We aren't properly accounting for things like e.g. the additional packaging cost incurred when a shipment contains a large format product vs. a small format one.

Gave feedback to one of our engineering leaders because i disagreed with the conclusions from an outage postmortem; the issue was actually that we didn't take a warning seriously, not something technical per-se. This speaks to an opportunity to improve our culture of quality, which is why I wanted to emphasize it; the upside there is higher than something where the takeaway is primarily technical.

Discovered something went live (a release I was excited about!) but hadn't seen analysis on the business impact, which triggered my spidey sense that perhaps it hadn't been analyzed in the way I anticipated; got together a slightly paniced call with the product manager, asked a couple of questions, and then asked for the change to be reverted until we had studied the impact further. Scheduled a meeting for the next morning to discuss with engineering and product leadership. No harm done, but glad it was caught -- everything might be fine with the change, but it's a complex system with some emergent (and high-impact!) behavior so we need a higher degree of precision and confidence to release.

Did a follow-up call from an architecture review meeting from last week. The team had made incredible progress on a new feature (really, an entirely new merchanidising tool), but I had a few questions about how content was going to be targeted and maintained by marketing over time. I had written a whitepaper on the issue about six months ago, but somehow it had never made it to the engineering leads (though the management team had read and reviewed it). It was a great conversation, with lots of good pushback. No decisions made, but I shared the paper, explained the reasonaing behind it, and I think the ideas will influence a few of the design aspects and lead to a better product.

Good introductory call to a senior executive who I don't really have a position for right now, but wanted to be sure to make the connection. Recruiting high-level folks is a looonnggg process so I'm always up for taking calls with folks who might be a great fit in a year or so.

Attended our monthly close meeting (e.g. reviewing the financial performance of the business), led by finance. It's a pretty dialed-in process at this point, and we can get through it in closer to 30 minutes vs. the hour it's scheduled for.
