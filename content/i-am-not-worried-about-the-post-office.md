I am not worried about the post office (this year).

There's been a lot of hand-wringing about USPS in the past month, as President Trump continues to fight against mail-in voting.

Taking all politics out of it, I started wondering whether we should, in fact, be worried about USPS's ability to deliver (literally, and metaphorically) successfully during the election season.

# Finances

USPS is not funded by tax dollars. To fund anything via tax dollars, congress appropriates the money for some purpose. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 set forth a schedule of weaning USPS off of appropriations entirely, with the last required appropriate happening in 1984. USPS is *allowed* to ask for additional funds from congress, but it has not done so since the appropriations laid out in the 1970 law phased out.

Presently, USPS funds itself from its own revenues (e.g. collecting payment in exchange for delivering mail), and does so fairly effectively, especially considering that its abilty to tweak pricing and service levels is severely constrained via legislation. USPS does lose gobs of money every month, however -- but it's not due to unprofitable operations. Instead, thanks to a 2006 law (The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act), USPS is required to pre-fund 75 years worth of pension benefits in a 10-year timeframe. This was passed by a Republican Congress with the intent of reducing the deficeit (paying down future obligations reduces deficeit).

It's worth noting though, that while USPS does not directly receive taxpayer dollars, it is exempt from federal income tax. With corporate tax in the ~25% range, this exemption added about $17bn (on revenues of $71bn) to USPS's top line in 2019.  theory gives USPS a market advantage over private compeitors whose cost of revenue is effectively 25% higher.
