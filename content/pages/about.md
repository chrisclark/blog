Hi there!

I'm Chris Clark. I'm co-founder
of [Grove Collaborative](https://www.grove.co). We're an eCommerce
brand that helps families make better decisions about the products
they use in their homes every day.

Before Grove, I ran product & engineering at
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) and got the opportunity to work with
fascinating, brilliant colleagues and a fascinating, brilliant
community of data scientists.

When I started my career, I thought I was going to be a good
engineer. It turns out I'm only an OK engineer, and am probably better
at building products and teams. I've working in Python, JavaScript,
Clojure, and .NET but now spend most of my time debugging
communication problems, and helping teams move fast.

I've have a number of open source projects, but really just one of
note;
[Django SQL Explorer](https://github.com/groveco/django-sql-explorer),
a SQL-based data sharing and query tool that has become reasonably
popular. Note that I firmly believe
[Django Sprinklers](https://github.com/groveco/django-sprinklers)
should be popular, but no one has ever paid attention to it. Learn
more on the [projects page](/pages/projects.html).

Once upon a time I created Oberon Socks, a
[men's dress sock]({filename}/images/oberon-socks.png) company, now
defunct.
