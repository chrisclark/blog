On November 17th, I chaired an event at the de Young Museum related to
the opening of the exhibit
[Danny Lyon: Message to the Future](https://deyoung.famsf.org/exhibitions/danny-lyon-message-future). It's
there through April 30th, 2017 and I encourage anyone in San Francisco
during its run to see it. Danny Lyon is a remarkable photographer and
artist, with a long history of nosing into important social themes, at
just the right time. The work of Bay Area photographer and
journalist [Darcy Padilla](http://www.darcypadilla.com/) is closely
related. She has spent her career in similar pursuits, with haunting
and memorable results.

Through ArtPoint, the young patron's group affiliated with the
museums, we hosted a conversation between Darcy and Julian Cox, the
curator who put together the Danny Lyon exhibit, in collaboration with
the artist, over the past few years. The discussion between Julian
and Darcy focused on her work, and the broader concerns of socially
conscious photo-journalism. My opening remarks are below.

### Remarks

The tangled intimacy of artist and subject is what grabbed me the
first time I saw Danny Lyon's work, and Darcy Padilla's.

With Lyon, it was a photo from The Bikeriders. A young man, about 20,
with a pock-marked face, leering out at me -- a face strikingly similar to
my father's, and wearing a motorcycle club jacket that my dad would
have been jealous of, having flirted with, but never quite fully
embraced, his own rebellious side.

And with Darcy, it was The Julie Project, the heart-wrenching,
decade-and-a-half-long photo-journalism story of Julie, a
mother trapped in relentless poverty, as she lived and died with
drugs, AIDS, and abuse. I came across The Julie Project at work, which
I would not recommend, as my colleagues are still worried about what
caused me to sob at my desk in the middle of a work day.

The images from Darcy, an award-winning photojournalist and
our guest here tonight, and Danny Lyon, in whose work you will find
many parallels, and you'll have the opportunity to view after this
program, these images are full to the brim with empathy.

These are images of immediate proximity. Of immediate understanding --
to people and situations otherwise hard to see, on the margins of
society.

Darcy & Danny have spent their careers documenting people, stories,
and narratives that are simply not in our usual line of sight.

They have both worked extensively in prisons, surfacing the
intentionally and knowingly hidden away. And both have documented
systemic poverty and disenfranchisement.

It is hard work to see from the perspective of others. It takes effort
and exertion and intention. These artists do this work on our behalf
so we can transmute from stories that would otherwise simply fade from
our collective consciousness.

Tonight, we have a unique opportunity to learn more. Julian Cox, chief
curator of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, will speak with
Darcy about present day photo-journalism, and her work. Afterwards,
please explore the exhibit Danny Lyon: Message to the Future, which
Julian has organized, and is the first comprehensive retrospective of
Lyon's work. It will remain open until 10pm, in the far galleries
on this floor.

On behalf of ArtPoint, and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, we
welcome you, our audience, and Julian and Darcy. Thank you, and enjoy.
