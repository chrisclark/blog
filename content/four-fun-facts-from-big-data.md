1. The credit card industry's term of art for false positives in fraud
detection is "insult rate". If you've ever swiped your card at a shop
and had it declined, you understand why.  
  
2. A large auto insurance company has discovered that if a household
owns two identical cars (same make, same model), that household's
driving risk is very low. They have termed this "the boring factor".  
  
3. Cable companies have trouble figuring out whether you are actually
watching TV - the box might be on, but the TV is off. But by inspecting
remote control button presses and using predictive models, they can
figure it out. If you hit the volume button, for instance, you're almost
certainly watching. And yes, that means every button press is probably
being logged.  
  
4. Look for paginated articles on news websites to start disappearing.
Paginating articles is a way for content providers to "manufacture
capacity" (ie. create pageviews against which they can sell
advertising). But new display advertising technologies only register an
ad impression when the ad is actually viewed (so ads at the bottom of
the page aren't counted if the user never scrolls them into view). With
the incentive for pagination gone, look for more long, scrolling
articles.
