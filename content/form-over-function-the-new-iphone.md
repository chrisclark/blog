I probably found this more profound than it really is, but Matt Buchanan
[said it
well](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/09/the-wonderfully-mundane-new-iphone.html)
in the New Yorker, regarding the latest iPhone announcements:  
  

> Fundamental technology, like manufacturing processes for processors

It's amazing to think that this is true; that the technological
achievements of these devices are perhaps being held back more by the
size and shape of our hands than by our manufacturing capabilities.
