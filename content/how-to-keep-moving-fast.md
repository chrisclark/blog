## Speed
  - Technology is a competitive advantage for us because of the flexibility and responsiveness it gives us.
    - Everyone in this space is slow and rigid. We are fast. We say yes.
  - For this advantage to remain, it means that we need to be able to continue to move fast, with confidence, even as complexity grows.
  - These means automated testing (and those tests serve as documentation). Without tests, you cannot refactor with confidence. Refactoring is *the* key to remaining fast.
  - This means understanding technical debt trade-offs, and isolating it.
  - Speed, quality, cost in software is not true. Speed and quality are the same thing. And speed is (or course) cost. So you can really pick all three, or none.
  - Building things has an ongoing price, in maintenance and added complexity. You need to keep those two factors at bay as you build in order to prevent getting bogged down.
  - Inherent slowness that's unavoidable comes from having to care about edge cases that were previously unnecessary to worry about because of very small scale. A thing that has a one-in-a-million chance of happening is no big deal when you're small. But it happens all the time if you have a hundred thousand users banging against that code path every day.
