The first thing I tell junior programmers is: KEEP GOING.

If you've been programming a while, you know that feeling of
encountering a new project, with a new stack, in a new language. The
feeling is: *Deep breath*. OK. And you roll up your sleeves and get to
work figuring it out.

But do you remember the first time you had that feeling? The first
time you were in a professional setting, in front of a new project
with years, or dozens of years, of engineer-hours invested in it, and
you are staring at a foreign IDE for the first time, and a senior
engineer has told you to fix a bug?  You have about 20 new
technologies to learn, all at once, and you don't have a solid
conceptual model for how they fit together. You're not sure if this is
a new language syntax, or a Dwarf Fortress game, and you're 10 steps
away from even being able to figure out what to Google.

It's overwhelming.

And I still find it overwhelming. I recently wanted to learn
ClojureScript. The recommended first step is basically, "spend 2 years
learning emacs". Then learn the Java ecosystem. Then learn
Clojure. Then learn ClojureScript. Yikes.

But the difference between just-out-of-school me, and me-today is that
I've had this feeling dozens and dozens (hundreds?) of times before. I
just barrel through. I start learning. I know that all of this
*stuff*, all of these layers, were built by other engineers. Some of
them are smarter than me, but it was all built to be used by other
engineers (by me!). I have complete confidence I will figure it out.

So that's what I tell new engineers: When you worry you might *not*
figure it out? That you weren't cut out for this? Been there. Been
there again. You'll figure it out, I promise. Just barrel through and
keep going.
