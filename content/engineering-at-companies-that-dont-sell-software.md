##  What does ENG do here?
  1. Hiring should remain sublinear to growth
  2. Bear 100% of the technical risk
  3. Be able to say 'yes' to the rest of the organization

## When do we build?
  1. When our data distinguishes us from the rest of the industry
     - Unique recurring model means we do our own forecasting
     - Uniquely small # of SKUs and SKU overlap means we build out own recommendation engine
     - Our fulfillment is standard; so we use off the shelf warehouse & order mgmt software
  2. Where we need to be uniquely differentiated

## How are we structured to meet the goals?
  1. ENG is responsible for tooling within ops, CS, inventory, and marketing. ENG provides service to these orgs, not exclusively product focused, and does not rely on IT.
