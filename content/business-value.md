We write code to deliver business value. We should therefore select solutions where most of the investment is going into the differentiated bits that drive business value.

This means we want to write more code that is only relevant to Grove (because it uniquely solves our business problems) and less code that is related to general scaling or infrastructure challenges. If we can buy solutions to the other problems (or just side-step them), letâ€™s do that, and take advantage of other customers of that 3rd party solution subsidizing the cost for us.
