It seems to me that one of the basic questions facing AI models is how they will be distributed. In the sense of "how is wealth distributed" not "how is software distributed".

The very surprising thing, to me, about the last year is that the various breakthroughs are yes, surprising, perhaps even shocking, but not particularly complex. They are *expensive*, but not very complex.

NetSuite is complex. ChatGPT is not.

The revelation of LLMs in 2023 is sort of like a bakery suddenly releasing a wildly better chocolate chip cookie. Like massively, inexplicably better than any cookie anyone has ever made before.

The secret, though, turns out not to be the recipe -- it's that, in the oven, alongside your tray of cookies, you also need to place and incinerate $20m dollars in cash.

The recipe is *sort of* complicated. But not *that* complicated. Any dedicated baker can do it. And everyone has a pretty good idea of the recipe. The trick is having $20m.
