If you're a software professional, there are basically two types of
companies you might work for; those whose products are fudamentally
software (they make money directly from technology), and those that
make their money some other way, but rely on software. Let's call the
first Type A, and the second Type B<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>.

## Type A Companies

These folks sell software, or otherwise directly monetize their
technology.

- Microsoft
- Twilio
- Dropbox

## Type B Companies

These guys are enabled by technology, but don't make money from it
directly.

- FedEx (fundamentally a logistics company)
- Amazon.com (the retailer; not AWS)
- Wells Fargo (and other financial institutions)

## Software Engineer at a Type A company

**Your job is to build awesome technology that customers will pay for.**

It's straightforward to be a technologist at a Type A company. The
software you create is very closely tied to revenue, which is
ultimately what drives business. The closer you are to the money, the
closer you are to the beating heart of any company.

Company cultures vary widely, and there are certainly Type A companies
led by sales and marketing (Oracle), and type A companies led by
engineering (Google). But regardless of the culture, engineers are
highly valued because they are ultimately responsible for revenue
generation. On the income statement, engineering & R&D are a cost
centers<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>, but they are also the golden
goose that made the business possible in the first place.

## Software Engineer at a Type B company

**Your job is to support the business goals of the organization.**

There's a spectrum here, both in terms of how crucial technology is to
the business, and the culture of the company.

On one end of the spectrum, we have Type B companies like Amazon (the
retailer) that make their money by selling and shipping physical
products, but have a very clear and important dependency on their
retail website, and a culture steeped in engineering. If the website
doesn't carefully meet consumer expectations, sales drop. There is a
true customer-facing component to the software, even if it's not being
monetized directly.

On the other end, we have banks. There's no question that banks run on
software, but the vast majority of it is internal and far from the
money. The quality of a bank's customer-facing website, ATM machines,
etc, has much less bearing on the success of the bank.
Correspondingly, engineers are lower on the cultural totem pole than
revenue-generating professionals.

## Further From the Money

Money is the central pillar of business, and the further from it you
are, the less influence you generally have.

In a Type B company, you're also a cost center, and perhaps one that's
viewed with a bit of skepticism. Is all this software really
necessary? Your work is more likely to be internal, rather than
customer-facing, and less glamorous IT tasks may be grouped with
engineering. It's more likely to be an auxilliary function, as opposed
to a core competency that differentiates the company, and thus more
likely to be outsourced (to a Type A company), or replaced with an
off-the-shelf solution.

## Closer to the Customer

But working for a Type B company can also be a heck of a lot of
fun. Your customers are often the folks sitting down the hall from
you. Product feedback is instant. Your users have less variance in
terms of training and environment, and everyone shares a lot of tribal
knowledge.

Good engineering is 20% building product right, and 80% building right
product. With the tight feedback loop you get developing for customers
down the hall, you're much more likely to get it right. And with a
forgiving customer base, often running on the same infrastructure, you
can iterate quickly. You can literally get a pat on the back for good
work.

## A Healthier Mindset

Early in my career, one of the things I looked for on resumes was
experience at a Type A company. I believed that the best engineers
would gravitate away from Type B companies, and that Type A employees
were more likely to be up to speed on high-quality development
practices.

But in the intervening years, two things have become readily apparent:

1. That's just not true. There are great people at any big, successful business.
2. Employees from Type B companies are often better collaborators.

Everyone has worked in or with a company that has an ivory-tower
engineering department. The common refrain is that no one can get
cycles from the engineering group; engineering doesn't think it's a
priority; engineers don't want to be distracted. Whether engineering
is at the top or the bottom of the cultural hierarchy, technology
exists to improve the lives of its users. Engineering is a functional
group like marketing, or sales, or operations. These teams need to
work alongside each other, not in a hierarchical way, but as
peers. The cultures in Type B companies are more liekly to foster that
mindset.

### Notes

<a name="footnote1">1</a>: This doesn't strictly apply to only
software companies. Boeing, for instance, clearly makes money directly
from their technology products...which are not strictly software
products. I would describe them more as giant flying tubes of metal.

with their "billable resources".
