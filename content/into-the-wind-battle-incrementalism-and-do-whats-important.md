Into the Wind: How to Battle Incrementalism & Do What's Important
--

Left to our own devices, we'll work on things we can control; things strictly within our own purview.

It takes emotional energy to interact with others and to navigate compromise, and negotiate tradeoffs.

It's fun to be an egineering hero and to work on something by oneself, to deliver a feature out of left field that saves the day or blows folks away.

Tactics are easier than strategy, and looking at a backlog of work, it's eaisiest to focus on things that are well-defined, self-encapsulated, and uncontroversial.

Important things are more likely to be second-guessed. They are more likely to require buy in. They are higher-risk, and more controversial.

Important things are not necessarily 'larger' or more complex, or require more engineering resources. But they are often

In order to work on important things, you must first know what's important (identification). This is the responsbility of management/leadership/executives.

And simply knowing isn't enough either - the context has to be fully communicated. This is because important things require activation energy.

The way you create activation energy within team members is by empowering them to think like owners, and giving them enough context that they understand why the important things are important. It's management's responsiblity to create that urgency and understanding.

Pointing at something and declaring it important rarely works; you might get a half-hearted pass at it, but soon attention will drift back to self-contained, lower-emotion work.

Let's say an employee is looking at 2 pieces of work on their plate. When looking at one, the internal monologue says "I can do that! I understand it, and I can deliver that value without leaving my desk." The other piece of work triggers a monologue like "So-and-so is pretty sensitive about that feature. I should probably talk to her before starting on that." Which do you think will get worked on first? But in fact, the worry about the second piece of work is actually a strong signal that it is more important. People care about it! A lot!

It's the managers job to provide enough context and empowerment (a true sense of ownership over the business) that the employee's inner voice has enough ammunition to win that argument -- to say "it might be a bit of a pain, but I know it's important." It's an onvious failure of management if the employee is not aware of which item is more important, but I often hear complaints that in spite of flagging what's important it still doesn't happen. "I laid out the priorities, but we just didn't seem to make progress against the important stuff." That is simply the failure of management to arm their team with so much context and understanding that it would be impossible for them to work on less important items.

You need to build up so much context that when an employee is looking at what to work on, the internalized reasons for the urgency of the important work drowns out the narrative of "I can do that!"

Important things require activation energy.
