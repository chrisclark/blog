Hi.

I'm Chris. I'm a co-founder at [Grove Collaborative](https://www.grove.co) (which used to be called ePantry), I formerly ran product & engineering at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com), and I'm a technologist at heart. Every now and again I run across something interesting enough in my work that I want to share it. Less frequently, I have the time and motivation to follow through, and if the stars align, it ends up here.

I created [Django SQL Explorer](https://github.com/groveco/django-sql-explorer), a SQL-based data sharing and query tool that has become reasonably popular.

Once upon a time I started a [men's dress sock]({filename}/images/oberon-socks.png) company, now defunct.

You can reach me at chris at untrod dot com.
