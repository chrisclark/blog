I'm travelling to Italy this week and thanks to some last-minute recommendations and changes by the EU, my wife and I were scrambling to line up suddenly-required COVID tests prior to our departure.

We got a lot of conflicting information about types of tests that would be accepted by Italy. In the end, I don't think it matters much, but it made me realize that I didn't really have a handle on the different tests types, how they worked, how they were named, and when one might be preferred over the other. Here's what I learned.

But first - note that I am extremely not a medical professional, or biologist, or scientist of any type. I'm a software guy, who is pretty good at Googling, and asking lots of questions to people who know what they are talking about

Nomenclature
Here are the words and terms I sorted through and learneed about:

Nucleic Acid Amplification (NAAT) Test
Ploymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Test
Molecular Test
Antigen Test
Antibody Test
