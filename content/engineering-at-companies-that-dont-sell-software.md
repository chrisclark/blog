If you're a software professional, there are two types of
companies you might work for; those whose products are fundamentally
software (they make money directly from technology), and those that
make their money some other way, but rely on software. Let's call the
first Type A, and the second Type B<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>.

## Type A Companies

These folks sell software, or otherwise directly monetize their
technology.

- Microsoft
- Twilio
- Dropbox

## Type B Companies

These guys are enabled by technology, but don't make money from it
directly.

- FedEx (fundamentally a logistics company)
- WalMart (big website, complex internal systems...but a retailer)
- Wells Fargo (and other financial institutions)

## Biased

Early in my career, one of the things I looked for on resumes was
experience at a Type A company. I believed that the best engineers
would gravitate away from Type B companies. I thought Type A employees
were more likely to be at the top of the talent heap, and more likely
to be current with the tools and practices of the trade.

But in the intervening years, two things have become apparent:

1. Where there is a big, successful business, there are great
   people<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>, and great systems<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup>.
2. Engineers with Type B experience are more likely to play well with
   others.

I can't stand engineering groups with superior attitudes, that aren't
supportive of the rest of the organization. A little competition
between departments is healthy, but if we're all building bicycles for
the mind, then fundamentally our job is to augment others. It's a
service job -- we build tools. A humble, cooperative attitude is
invaluable.

There are a few reasons I think Type B companies do a better job
fostering this attitude.

## Software Engineer at a Type A company

**Your job is to build awesome technology that customers will pay for.**

**You are close to the money**

It's straightforward to be a technologist at a Type A company. The
software you create is very closely tied to revenue, which is
ultimately what drives business. The closer you are to the money, the
closer you are to the beating heart of a company.

On the income statement, engineering & R&D are a cost
centers<sup>[4](#footnote4)</sup>, but they are also the golden
goose that made the business possible in the first place.

In the words of one engineer I worked with "If it doesn't come out of
these fingers, it doesn't happen."

## Software Engineer at a Type B company

**Your job is to support the business goals of the organization.**

**You are further from the money**

In a Type B company, you're a true cost center, and perhaps viewed
with a bit of skepticism. Is all this software really necessary?

- Your work is more likely to be internal, rather than
customer-facing.
- It's more likely to be an auxiliary function, as
opposed to a market differentiator
    - Even at tech-heavy Type B companies this is
      true<sup>[3](#footnote3</sup>; Amazon's differentiator is not
      the quality of their website. It's their selection, pricing
      power, and market position.
- When it's not a differentiator, every project is subject to a
  build-or-buy decision.

Money is the central pillar of business, and the further from it you
are, the less influence you have.

## Closer to the Customer

But working for a Type B company can also be a heck of a lot of
fun. Your customers are often the folks sitting down the hall from
you. Product feedback is instant. You might get a literal pat on the
back for a job well done. Your users have less variance in terms of
training and environment, and everyone shares a lot of tribal
knowledge.

Good engineering is 20% building product right, and 80% building right
product. With the tight feedback loop you get developing internally,
you're much more likely to get it right. And with a forgiving customer
base, often running on the same infrastructure, you can iterate
quickly.

## A Healthier Mind-set

If I never overhear the following at my company, we're doing good
work:

- "I can't get cycles from the engineering group."
- "Engineering doesn't think it's a priority."
- "I'm nervous to ask because I don't want to distract anyone on the
  engineering team."

Whether engineering is at the top or the bottom of the cultural
hierarchy, technology exists to improve the lives of its
users. Engineering is a functional group like marketing, or sales, or
operations. These teams need to work alongside each other as
peers. The cultures in Type B companies are more likely to foster that
mind set.

### Notes

<a name="footnote1">1</a>: This doesn't strictly apply to only
software companies. Boeing, for instance, clearly makes money directly
from their technology products...which are not strictly software
products. I would describe them more as giant flying tubes of metal.

<a name="footnote2">2</a>: I do still believe that bad engineers are
more likely to be hiding out at Type B companies, but that has no
bearing if you are trying to recruit top performers. You'll spot them
right away. The difference between MIT and Virginia Polytech is not at the
top of the class; both have some of the world's best. But at the
bottom of the class, there's more room to hide in a larger, less
focused organization.

<a name="footnote3">3</a>: Popular, influential open-source projects
came out of Type B companies all the time. The New York Times alone
produces incredible open source projects, from D3 to their Objective-C
Style Guide, to Gizmo. And don't forget that Django was created by the
Lawrence Journal-World newspaper.

<a name="footnote4">4</a>: Excluding Amazon Web Services, of
course. I'm talking about Amazon the retailer.
