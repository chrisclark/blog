Title: Scale Isn't What You Think

Scale is not about volume and traffic and size.

Scale is about a massive increase in complexity due to corner-cases becoming high ROI opportunities as revenue increases.

Here's a good example from Grove: Preventing multiple sign-ups. We offer a free gift set to new customer to incentivize them to try Grove. We've always found that some small percentage (let's call it 1 of every 1000) of customers will sign up, cancel their account, and sign up again to receive the incentive multiple times.

In the early stages, it's inconceivable that a start-up would spend any time trying to prevent this. You have zero customers and a low-single-digit engineering team.

But at some point, if you are acquiring a million customers per month, and you have a team of a hundred engineers, it's clearly ROI positive to address this issue. You now have 1000 duplicate sign-ups per month, each one costing you perhaps $50 -- getting an engineer to spend a few weeks addressing it is a no-brainer.

This becomes true across hundreds of corner cases. It is the thing that causes companies to employ hundreds or thousands of engineers. And it's the thing that introduces massive complexity that causes "scale challenges".
