Hi there.

I'm Chris Clark. I'm co-founder of [Grove Collaborative](https://www.grove.co) (formerly called ePantry, if you see references to that name in early posts). We're an ecommerce brand that helps families make better decisions about the products they use in their homes every day.

Before Grove, I ran product & engineering at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) and got the opportunity to work with fascinating, billiant colleagues and a fascinating, brilliant community of data scientists.

When I started my career, I thought I was going to be a very good engineer. It turns out I'm only an OK engineer, and am probably better at building products and teams. I've Pytho, JavaScript, Clojure, and .NET but now spend most of my time debugging communication problems, and helping teams move fast.

I've have a number of open source projects, but really just one of note; [Django SQL Explorer](https://github.com/groveco/django-sql-explorer), a SQL-based data sharing and query tool that has become reasonably popular. Note that I firmly believe [Django Sprinklers](https://github.com/groveco/django-sprinklers) should be popular, but I'm not sure how to get the word out. Learn more on the [projects page](/pages/projects.html).

Once upon a time I created Oberon Socks, a [men's dress sock]({filename}/images/oberon-socks.png) company, now defunct.
