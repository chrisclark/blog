In the beginning, the team is like family. You're all friends. Everyone is pulling on the rope together, in the same direction. Some days good things happen, and the family is happy. And there are bad days too.

Lessons learned when making the transition:

1. It's not about increasing good vibes, it's about being steady.
2. Off-the-cutt communication from management stops working.
3. Perverse incentives take hold as context gets lost.
4. Consistent performance becomes more important than sprinting.
5. High-level goals can be disempowering.
