I love taking notes in Org Mode in Emacs but have run into a few issues over the years attemping to do this as my job shifted from individual contributor to manager/executive.

Specifically, there are a number of small inconveniences that add up to a less-than-ideal note taking experience:

- Creating a new Org Mode buffer quickly
- Good export formats & settings
- Ability to "share" notes easily with colleagues (collaboration)
- Make sure notes don't get lost if emacs closes
- On-disk organization of notes
- Searching for notes (finding them later)

## Problem 1: Creating a new note

Over the years, I built up the bad habit of C-x b <gibberish>.org <return> to get a new Org Mode buffer. But, if emacs closes, I lose the notes; the buffer is not visiting a file so auto-save does not work.

Closely related to this problem is the general issue of "Where do I save the notes and how do I keep them organized?"

## Problem 2: Finding notes later (search)

I have a folder full of notes. How can I find things I wrote months ago, quickly?

## Problem 3: Publishing / sharing notes
